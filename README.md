# salt-ceph
FILE is WIP

docu and examples missing


This project directly started from scratch, but was influenced by the fabulous work of Mr. Alen Komljen ceph-salt projects (https://github.com/komljen/ceph-salt).

Install and configure Ceph with Saltstack, configure options, create pools, create auth keys  (for libvirt, cinder, glance etc.)

For using it the salt-orchestration-ceph is required
